# BrowserAuthAuto
Automates a variety of websites' operations by using a login to access contents or do something. Maintains the login information throughout the applications lifespan.

To run:
Execute as a normal Python file/script. You will need the Selenium WebDriver for your particular browser in order to successfully run the program. Note that in the code in start(), the path named "DRIVER_PATH" is specified. This will need to be changed among other users because this driver must be downloaded, which can be found here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started
For now, the user would have to enter their email and password separately in the code for a successful login. When executing the Python file, the user will be prompted with a menu in which they will choose the website they wish to login to.
